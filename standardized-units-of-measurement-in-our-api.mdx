The API operates using the **International System of Units (SI)**. Consequently, all data, including measurements pertaining to distance, time, weight, temperature, and more, is conveyed in SI units, ensuring uniformity and precision throughout the API.

Nonetheless, we recognize the diverse requirements of our global user base. In response to this, we are excited to announce our forthcoming capability to configure the measurement system within the API settings. This will grant you the flexibility to interact with our API using the measurement system that aligns best with your specific needs.

Please stay tuned for further updates regarding this feature!
